# TEDxUofW Motion Testing 2025

A comprehensive toolkit for creating and displaying dynamic dot grid animations for the TEDxUofW 2025 website. This project consists of two main components:

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1. [hero-grid-dots](./hero-grid-dots)
Python-based video processing toolkit that extracts dot size information from video frames with subpixel precision. This component:
- Processes source videos into grid-based animation data
- Performs frame interpolation for smooth 60 FPS output
- Generates optimized JSON data for web consumption

### 2. [tedx-testing](./tedx-testing)
React-based web application that implements the interactive dot grid animations. This component:
- Renders the dynamic dot grid animations
- Provides an interactive hero section
- Consumes the animation data generated by hero-grid-dots

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Create source animation video
2. Process video using `hero-grid-dots` to extract dot size data
3. Place generated JSON in the React application
4. Configure and display the animation using the React components

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. First, process your animation:
   ```bash
   cd hero-grid-dots
   # Follow instructions in hero-grid-dots/README.md
   ```

2. Then, run the web application:
   ```bash
   cd tedx-testing
   # Follow instructions in tedx-testing/README.md
   ```
